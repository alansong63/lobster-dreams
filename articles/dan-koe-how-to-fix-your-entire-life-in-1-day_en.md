You're probably going to quit your new years resolution.

And that's okay. Most people do (studies show 80-90% failure rates) because most people don't actually want to change on a deep, internal level. That is, they go about changing their life in the completely wrong way. They create a new years resolution because everyone else does – humans want to impress others more than they want to impress themselves... we create a superficial meaning out of status games – but they don't meet the requirements for true change, which goes a lot deeper than convincing yourself you're going to be more disciplined or productive this year.

I'm not here to talk down on you. I've quit 10 times more goals than I've set. I think that should be the case for most people. But the fact that people try to change their lives and utterly fail almost every time holds true. So much so that it's a meme for the gym to be crowded during January and return back to normal in February.

However, as much as I think new years resolutions are stupid, it's always wise to reflect on the life you hate so you can launch yourself toward something that much better, as we will discuss.

Human nature is a b*tch, and the worst feeling is when you make a promise to yourself and can't help but break it. You start to feel helpless, and if you don't know what you're doing, you may continue the cycle for years on end: always wanting to change, but never being able to.

So whether you want to start the business, transform your body, or take the risk toward a more meaningful life without quitting after 2 weeks, I want to share 7 ideas you probably haven't heard before on behavior change, psychology, and productivity so you can do just that in 2026.

This will be comprehensive. This isn't one of those letters that you read through and forget about. This is something you will want to bookmark, take notes on, and set aside time to think about. The protocol at the end – to dig deep into your psyche and uncover what you truly want in life – will take about a full day to complete, with effects that last far longer than that.

All I ask is that you dedicate your full attention to this. If you get bored skip to the next section and go back to fill in the blanks if you need to.

Let's begin.

## Part 1: You Haven't Reached Your Ideal Position Because You Aren't That Type of Person

When it comes to New Year's resolutions, people only focus on one of the two requirements for success:

- Changing your actions to make progress toward the goal (least important, second order)
- Changing who you are so that your behavior naturally follows (most important, first order)

Most people set a surface-level goal, hype themselves up to remain disciplined for the first few weeks, then go back to their old ways without much struggle, because they were trying to build a great life on a rotting foundation.

If this doesn't make sense, let's run through an example.

Think of somebody successful. It can be a bodybuilder with a great physique, a founder/CEO worth hundreds of millions, or a charismatic dude who can chat up a group without a shred of anxiety entering his mind space.

Do you think the bodybuilder has to "grind" to eat healthy? Does the CEO have to discipline themselves to show up and lead the team? To you, it may seem like that on the surface, but the truth is that they can't see themselves living any other way. The bodybuilder has to grind to eat unhealthily. The CEO has to force themselves to lie in bed past their alarm clock, and they hate every second of it.

To some people, my own lifestyle seems a bit extreme and disciplined. To me, it's natural, and I don't say that to contrast it with any other kind of lifestyle. I simply enjoy living this way. When my mom tells me that I should take a break, go out, and have some fun... I hold my tongue from telling her, "If I weren't having fun, why would I be doing what I'm doing?"

**Do not take this next sentence lightly.**

If you want a specific outcome in life, you must have the lifestyle that creates that outcome long before you reach it.

If someone says they want to lose 30 pounds, I often don't believe them. Not because I don't think they are capable, but because there are too many times when that same person says "they can't wait until they're done losing weight so they can start to enjoy life again." I hate to break it to you, but if you don't adopt the lifestyle that led to you losing the weight, for life, and find a reason with a higher gravitational pull than the one tying you to your previous ways, then you will go straight back to where you started, and you can unhappily say that you wasted the resource you will never get back: time.

When you truly change yourself, all of your habits that don't move the needle toward your goal become disgusting, because you have a deep and profound awareness of what kind of life those actions compound into. You are okay with your current standards because you are not fully aware of what they are or what they lead to.

You say you want to change. You say you want to "become financially free" and "get healthy," but your actions show otherwise for a reason. And it goes a lot deeper than you think.

> – Alfred Adler

## Part 2: You Haven't Reached Your Ideal Position Because You Don't Want to Go There

If you want to change who you are, you must understand how the mind works so that you can start to reprogram it.

The first step to understanding the mind is to understand that **all behavior is goal-oriented**.

You take a step forward because you want to reach a certain location.
You scratch your nose because you want to make the itch go away.

Those ones are clear, but most of the time, **your goals are unconscious**. You may not realize that when you sit on the couch in the middle of the day, you are trying to burn time before your next responsibility, as one simple example.

On an even more unconscious and complex level, you pursue goals that can harm you, but you justify your actions in a way that is socially acceptable and doesn't make you seem like a loser.

As an example, if you can't stop procrastinating your work, you may justify it with the fact that you "lack discipline," but in reality, you are attempting to achieve a goal like you always are. In this case, that goal could be to protect yourself from the judgment that comes from finishing and sharing your work.

If you say you want to quit your dead-end job, but stay in it without any real reason, you may start to think you don't have enough courage, or that you were never really a "risk taker," but the truth is that **you are pursuing the goal of safety, predictability, and an excuse to not look like a failure** to everyone else in your life who also works a dead-end job.

**The lesson here is that real change requires changing your goals.**

I don't mean setting some surface level goal because the act of doing that serves an unconscious goal that is actually harming you. I mean changing your point of view. Because that's what a goal is. A goal is a projection into the future that acts as a lens of perception which allows you to notice information, ideas, and resources that aid in you achieving that goal.

## Part 3: You Haven't Reached Your Ideal Position Because You're Afraid of Getting There

> "It matters not in the least how you got the idea or where it came from. You may never have met a professional hypnotist. You may never have been formally hypnotized. But if you have accepted an idea—and further, if you are firmly convinced that idea is true—it has the same power over you as the hypnotist's words have over the hypnotized subject."
> – Maxwell Maltz

Here's how you've become who you are today, and how you will become who you will be tomorrow. This is the **anatomy of identity**:

1. You want to achieve a goal
2. You perceive reality through the lens of that goal
3. You only notice "important" information and ideas that allows you to achieve that goal
4. You act toward that goal and receive feedback that you are progressing toward it
5. You repeat that behavior until it becomes automatic and unconscious (conditioning)
6. That behavior becomes a part of who you think you are ("I am the type of person who...")
7. You defend your identity to maintain psychological consistency
8. Your identity shapes new goals, restarting the cycle

The unfortunate reality is that you must break the cycle between steps 6 and 7, but this process starts when you are a child.

You have the goal of survival. You are dependent on your parents to teach you how to survive. You had to conform. And since the way most people teach is through reward and punishment, unless you adopt their beliefs and values, you will be punished.

When your identity feels threatened, the same thing happens as when your body feels threatened. If you are heavily identified with a political ideology, you will feel threatened when someone challenges your beliefs. You literally feel the stress. You feel, emotionally, like you were just slapped in the face.

## Part 4: The Life You Want Exists at Specific Levels of Mind

The mind evolves through predictable stages over time. When you're born, you're like a little survival sponge that absorbs whatever beliefs you can (which are heavily dictated by your culture) so that you can feel safe and secure.

Here's the **9 stages of ego development** (80/20 version):

1. **Impulsive** — No separation between impulse and action. Black and white thinking.
2. **Self-Protective** — The world is dangerous and you learn to look out for yourself.
3. **Conformist** — You are your group and its rules feel like reality itself.
4. **Self-Aware** — You notice you have an inner life that doesn't match the exterior.
5. **Conscientious** — You build your own system of principles and hold yourself accountable to them.
6. **Individualist** — You see that your principles were shaped by context and start holding them more loosely.
7. **Strategist** — You work with systems while aware of your own involvement in them.
8. **Construct-Aware** — You see all frameworks, including your identity, as useful fictions.
9. **Unitive** — Separation between self and life dissolves.

For most people reading this, I would assume you hover between 4 and 8. The good thing is, it doesn't really matter what stage you are in, because moving through any of them follows a pattern.

## Part 5: Wisdom is the Ability to Get What You Want Out of Life

> "The only real test of intelligence is if you get what you want out of life."
> – Naval Ravikant

There is a formula for success:
- One ingredient is **agency** (the ability to act)
- One ingredient is **opportunity**
- The last ingredient is **intelligence**

**Intelligence in this context means understanding cybernetics:**

- To have a goal
- Act toward that goal
- Sense where you are
- Compare it to the goal
- And act again based on that feedback

High intelligence is the ability to iterate, persist, and understand the big picture. The mark of low intelligence is the inability to learn from your mistakes.

**To become more intelligent, you must:**
- Reject the known path
- Dive into the unknown
- Set new, higher goals to expand your mind
- Embrace the chaos and allow for growth
- Study the generalized principles of nature
- Become a deep generalist

## Part 6: The 1-Day Life Reset Protocol

> "The best periods of my life always came after a period of getting absolutely fed up with the lack of progress I was making."

This protocol helps you reach **dissonance**, navigate through **uncertainty**, and discover what it truly is that you want to achieve.

**Structure:**
- Morning: Psychological excavation
- Throughout the Day: Interrupting autopilot
- Evening: Synthesizing insight

### Part 1) Morning – Psychological Excavation – Vision & Anti-Vision

Set aside 15-30 minutes to think about and answer these questions:

**Awareness questions:**
- What is the dull and persistent dissatisfaction you've learned to live with?
- What do you complain about repeatedly but never actually change?
- For each complaint: What would someone who watched your behavior conclude that you actually want?
- What truth about your current life would be unbearable to admit to someone you deeply respect?

**Anti-Vision questions (5 years):**
- If nothing changes, describe an average Tuesday. Where do you wake up? What does your body feel like? What's the first thing you think about? Who is around you? What do you do between 9am and 6pm? How do you feel at 10pm?

**Anti-Vision questions (10 years):**
- What have you missed? What opportunities closed? Who gave up on you? What do people say about you?

**Identity questions:**
- What identity would you have to give up to actually change?
- What is the most embarrassing reason you haven't changed?
- If your current behavior is self-protection, what exactly are you protecting? And what is that protection costing you?

**Vision questions:**
- If you could snap your fingers and be living a different life in three years, what does an average Tuesday look like?
- What would you have to believe about yourself for that life to feel natural?
- Write the identity statement: "I am the type of person who..."

### Part 2) Throughout the Day – Interrupting Autopilot

Create reminders in your phone with these questions:

- **11:00am:** What am I avoiding right now by doing what I'm doing?
- **1:30pm:** If someone filmed the last two hours, what would they conclude I want from my life?
- **3:15pm:** Am I moving toward the life I hate or the life I want?
- **5:00pm:** What's the most important thing I'm pretending isn't important?
- **7:30pm:** What did I do today out of identity protection rather than genuine desire?
- **9:00pm:** When did I feel most alive today? When did I feel most dead?

### Part 3) Evening – Synthes Insight – Entering A Season of Progress

- After today, what feels most true about why you've been stuck?
- What is the actual enemy? Name it clearly. (Not circumstances. Not other people.)
- Write a single sentence that captures what you refuse to let your life become (anti-vision compressed).
- Write a single sentence that captures what you're building toward (vision MVP).

**Goal framework (as a lens, not a finish line):**

- **One-year lens:** What would have to be true in one year for you to know you've broken the old pattern?
- **One-month lens:** What would have to be true in one month for the one-year lens to remain possible?
- **Daily lens:** What are 2-3 actions you can timeblock tomorrow that the person you're becoming would simply do?

## Part 7: Turn Your Life into a Video Game

> "The optimal state of inner experience is one in which there is order in consciousness. This happens when psychic energy—or attention—is invested in realistic goals, and when skills match the opportunities for action."
> – Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi

You now have all of the components that lead to a good life. Organize your insights into one coherent plan:

- **Anti-vision** – What is the bane of my existence?
- **Vision** – What is the ideal life?
- **1-year goal** – What will my life look like in 1 year?
- **1-month project** – What do I need to learn? What skills?
- **Daily levers** – What are the priority tasks?
- **Constraints** – What am I not willing to sacrifice?

**Why is this so powerful?**

Because these components create your own little world. You turn your life into a video game.

- Your vision = how you win
- Your anti-vision = what happens if you lose
- Your 1-year goal = the mission
- Your 1-month project = the boss fight
- Your daily levers = the quests
- Your constraints = the rules

All of these act as a concentric set of circles, like a forcefield, that guard your mind from distractions. The more you play the game, the stronger this force becomes, and soon enough it becomes who you are.
