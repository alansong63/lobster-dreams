# Steam, Steel, and Infinite Minds / 蒸汽、钢铁与无限的智慧

---

Every era is shaped by its miracle material. Steel forged the Gilded Age. Semiconductors switched on the Digital Age. Now AI has arrived as infinite minds. If history teaches us anything, those who master the material define the era.

每个时代都由其神奇材料所塑造。钢铁锻造了镀金时代。半导体开启了数字时代。现在，人工智能作为无限的智慧降临了。如果历史教会了我们什么，那就是掌握材料的人定义时代。

In the 1850s, Andrew Carnegie ran through muddy Pittsburgh streets as a telegraph boy. Six in ten Americans were farmers. Within two generations, Carnegie and his peers forged the modern world. Horses gave way to railroads, candlelight to electricity, iron to steel.

在1850年代，安德鲁·卡内基作为一名电报员奔跑在匹兹堡泥泞的街道上。当时十个美国人中有六个是农民。在两代人的时间里，卡内基和他的同辈锻造了现代世界。马匹让位于铁路，烛光让位于电力，铁让位于钢铁。

Since then, work shifted from factories to offices. Today I run a software company in San Francisco, building tools for millions of knowledge workers. In this industry town, everyone is talking about AGI, but most of the two billion desk workers have yet to feel it. What will knowledge work look like soon? What happens when the org chart absorbs minds that never sleep?

从那时起，工作从工厂转移到办公室。今天，我在旧金山经营一家软件公司，为数百万知识工作者构建工具。在这个行业小镇，每个人都在谈论AGI（通用人工智能），但20亿办公室工作人员中的大多数人还没有感受到它。未来的知识工作会是什么样子？当组织架构图吸收了永不休息的大脑时会发生什么？

Early movies often looked like stage plays, with one camera focused on the stage.

**早期的电影通常看起来像舞台剧，只有一个摄像机聚焦在舞台上。**

---

This future is often difficult to predict because it always disguises itself as the past. Early phone calls were concise like telegrams. Early movies looked like filmed plays. (This is what Marshall McLuhan called "driving to the future via the rearview window.")

这个未来往往难以预测，因为它总是伪装成过去。早期的电话像电报一样简洁。早期的电影看起来像拍摄的舞台剧。（这就是马歇尔·麦克卢汉所说的"通过后视镜驶向未来"）

---

The most popular form of AI today look like Google search of the past.

今天最流行的AI形式看起来像过去的谷歌搜索。

---

To quote Marshall McLuhan: "we are always driving into the future via the rearview window."

引用马歇尔·麦克卢汉的话："我们总是通过后视镜驶向未来。"

---

Today, we see this as AI chatbots which mimic Google search boxes. We're now deep in that uncomfortable transition phase which happens with every new technology shift.

今天，我们看到AI聊天机器人模仿谷歌搜索框。我们现在正处于每一次新技术转型都会发生的那种不舒服的过渡阶段。

---

I don't have all the answers on what comes next. But I like to play with a few historical metaphors to think about how AI can work at different scales, from individuals to organizations to whole economies.

我没有所有关于接下来会发生什么的答案。但我喜欢用一些历史比喻来思考AI如何在不同尺度上发挥作用，从个人到组织再到整个经济。

## Individuals: from bicycles to cars

## 个人：从自行车到汽车

The first glimpses can be found with the high priests of knowledge work: programmers.

第一瞥可以在知识工作的大祭司身上找到：程序员。

---

My co-founder Simon was what we call a 10× programmer, but he rarely writes code these days. Walk by his desk and you'll see him orchestrating three or four AI coding agents at once, and they don't just type faster, they think, which together makes him a 30-40× engineer. He queues tasks before lunch or bed, letting them work while he's away. He's become a manager of infinite minds.

我的联合创始人西蒙曾经是我们所谓的10倍程序员，但他现在很少写代码。走过他的办公桌，你会看到他同时指挥三四个AI编码代理，它们不仅仅是打字更快，它们会思考，这使他成为了一个30-40倍的工程师。他在午餐或睡前排队任务，让它们在他不在的时候工作。他成为了无限思维的经理。

A 1970s Scientific American study on locomotion efficiency inspired Steve Jobs's famous 'bicycle for the mind' metaphor. Except we've been pedaling on the Information Superhighway for decades since.

**1970年代《科学美国人》关于移动效率的研究激发了史蒂夫·乔布斯著名的"思维自行车"比喻。除了我们已经在这条信息高速公路上骑了几十年的自行车。**

---

In the 1980s, Steve Jobs called personal computers "bicycles for the mind." A decade later, we paved the "information superhighway" that is the internet. But today, most knowledge work is still human-powered. It's like we've been pedaling bicycles on the autobahn.

在1980年代，史蒂夫·乔布斯称个人计算机为"思维的自行车"。十年后，我们铺设了互联网这条"信息高速公路"。但今天，大多数知识工作仍然是人力驱动的。这就像我们在高速公路上骑自行车。

---

With AI agents, someone like Simon has graduated from riding a bicycle to driving a car.

有了AI代理，像西蒙这样的人已经从骑自行车升级到了开车。

---

When will other types of knowledge workers get cars? Two problems must be solved.

其他知识工作者何时能开上车？必须解决两个问题。

---

Comparing with coding agent, why is it more difficult for AI to help with knowledge work? Because knowledge work is more fragmented and less verifiable.

**与编码代理相比，为什么AI更难帮助知识工作？因为知识工作更加分散，更难验证。**

---

First, context fragmentation. For coding, tools and context tend to live in one place: the IDE, the repo, the terminal. But general knowledge work is scattered across dozens of tools. Imagine an AI agent trying to draft a product brief: it needs to pull from Slack threads, a strategy doc, last quarter's metrics in a dashboard, and institutional memory that lives only in someone's head. Today, humans are the glue, stitching all that together with copy-paste and switching between browser tabs. Until that context is consolidated, agents will stay stuck in narrow use-cases.

**首先，上下文分散。**对于编码来说，工具和上下文往往集中在一个地方：IDE、代码库、终端。但一般知识工作分散在几十个工具中。想象一下，一个AI代理试图起草产品简介：它需要从Slack对话、战略文档、上季度仪表板中的指标以及只存在于某人大脑中的机构记忆中提取信息。今天，人类是胶水，通过复制粘贴和切换浏览器标签将所有东西缝合在一起。除非上下文得到整合，否则代理将局限于狭窄的用例。

---

The second missing ingredient is verifiability. Code has a magical property: you can verify it with tests and errors. Model makers use this to train AI to get better at coding (e.g. reinforcement learning). But how do you verify if a project is managed well, or if a strategy memo is any good? We haven't yet found ways to improve models for general knowledge work. So humans still need to be in the loop to supervise, guide, and show what good looks like.

**第二个缺失的要素是可验证性。**代码有一个神奇的属性：你可以通过测试和错误来验证它。模型制作者利用这一点来训练AI更好地编码（例如，强化学习）。但你如何验证一个项目是否管理得好，或者一份战略备忘录是否优秀？我们还没有找到改进通用知识工作模型的方法。所以人类仍然需要在循环中监督、指导，并展示什么是好的。

---

The Red Flag Act of 1865 required a flag bearer to walk ahead of the vehicle while it drove down the street (repealed in 1896). An example of undesirable "human in the loop."

**1865年的《红旗法案》要求一名持旗人在车辆驶下街道时走在前面（于1896年废除）。这是不可取的"人在循环中"的一个例子。**

---

Programming agents this year taught us that having a "human-in-the-loop" isn't always desirable. It's like having someone personally inspect every bolt on a factory line, or walk in front of a car to clear the road (see: the Red Flag Act of 1865). We want humans to supervise the loops from a leveraged point, not be in them. Once context is consolidated and work is verifiable, billions of workers will go from pedaling to driving, and then from driving to self-driving.

今年的编程代理教会我们，拥有"人在循环中"并不总是可取的。这就像有人亲自检查工厂线上的每个螺栓，或者在车前行走以清理道路（见1865年的《红旗法案》）。我们希望人类从有杠杆作用的点监督循环，而不是在循环中。一旦上下文得到整合且工作可验证，数十亿工人将从骑自行车转变为开车，然后从开车转变为自动驾驶。

## Organizations: steel and steam

## 组织：钢铁与蒸汽

---

Companies are a recent invention. They degrade as they scale and reach their limit.

公司是最近的发明。它们随着规模扩大而退化并达到极限。

---

Organizational chart for the New York and Erie Railroad, 1855. The modern corporation and org chart evolved with the railroad companies, which were the first enterprises that needed to coordinate thousands of people across great distances.

**1855年纽约和伊利铁路公司的组织架构图。现代公司和组织架构图随着铁路公司而发展，铁路公司是第一批需要在远距离协调数千人的企业。**

---

A few hundred years ago, most companies were workshops of a dozen people. Now we have multinationals with hundreds of thousands. The communication infrastructure (human brains connected by meetings and messages) buckles under exponential load. We try to solve this with hierarchy, process, and documentation. But we've been solving an industrial-scale problem with human-scale tools, like building a skyscraper with wood.

几百年前，大多数公司是十几人的作坊。现在我们有拥有数十万人的跨国公司。沟通基础设施（通过会议和消息连接的人脑）在指数级负荷下弯曲。我们试图通过层级、流程和文档来解决这个问题。但我们一直在用人级工具解决工业规模的问题，就像用木材建造摩天大楼一样。

---

Two historical metaphors show how future organizations can look differently with new miracle materials.

两个历史比喻表明，未来的组织如何用新的神奇材料呈现不同的面貌。

---

A wonder of steel: the Woolworth building was the tallest building in the world upon completion in NYC, 1913.

**钢铁的奇迹：1913年完工时，伍尔沃思大楼是纽约市最高的建筑。**

---

The first is steel. Before steel, buildings in the 19th century had a limit of six or seven floors. Iron was strong but brittle and heavy; add more floors, and the structure collapsed under its own weight. Steel changed everything. It's strong yet malleable. Frames could be lighter, walls thinner, and suddenly buildings could rise dozens of stories. New kinds of buildings became possible.

首先是钢铁。在钢铁之前，19世纪的建筑物有六七层的限制。铁坚固但易碎且沉重；增加更多楼层，结构就会在自己的重量下倒塌。钢铁改变了一切。它坚固而可塑。框架可以更轻，墙壁可以更薄，突然间建筑物可以上升到几十层。新类型的建筑成为可能。

---

AI is steel for organizations. It has the potential to maintain context across workflows and surface decisions when needed without the noise. Human communication no longer has to be the load-bearing wall. The weekly two-hour alignment meeting becomes a five-minute async review. The executive decision that required three levels of approval might soon happen in minutes. Companies can scale, truly scale, without the degradation we've accepted as inevitable.

**AI是组织的钢铁。**它有潜力在工作流程中维护上下文，并在需要时呈现决策而不产生噪音。人类沟通不再必须是承重墙。每周两小时的对齐会议变成五分钟的异步审查。需要三层批准的行政决策可能很快在几分钟内完成。公司可以扩展，真正扩展，而不会出现我们认为是不可避免的退化。

---

A mill with a water wheel to power its operations. Water was powerful but unreliable and restricted mills to a few locations and seasonality.

**带有水轮的工厂为其运营提供动力。水强大但不可靠，并将工厂限制在几个地点和季节性。**

---

The second story is about the steam engine. At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, early textile factories sat next to rivers and streams and were powered by waterwheels. When the steam engine arrived, factory owners initially swapped waterwheels for steam engines and kept everything else the same. Productivity gains were modest.

第二个故事是关于蒸汽机的。在工业革命开始时，早期的纺织厂坐落在河流和小溪旁边，由水轮驱动。当蒸汽机到来时，工厂主最初将水轮换成蒸汽机，其他一切都保持不变。生产力的提高是温和的。

---

The real breakthrough came when factory owners realized they could decouple from water entirely. They built larger mills closer to workers, ports, and raw materials. And they redesigned their factories around steam engines (Later, when electricity came online, owners further decentralized away from a central power shaft and placed smaller engines around the factory for different machines.) Productivity exploded, and the Second Industrial Revolution really took off.

真正的突破发生在工厂主意识到他们可以完全脱离水的时候。他们在靠近工人、港口和原材料的地方建造了更大的工厂。他们围绕蒸汽机重新设计了工厂（后来，当电力上线时，所有者进一步从中央动力轴分散，在工厂周围为不同的机器放置较小的发动机）。生产力爆炸式增长，第二次工业革命真正起飞。

---

This 1835 engraving by Thomas Allom depicts a textile factory in Lancashire, UK. It was powered by steam engines.

**这幅1835年托马斯·阿洛姆的版画描绘了英国兰开夏郡的一家纺织厂。它由蒸汽机驱动。**

---

We're still in the "swap out the waterwheel" phase. AI chatbots bolted onto existing tools. We haven't reimagined what organizations look like when the old constraints dissolve and your company can run on infinite minds that work while you sleep.

**我们仍处于"换掉水轮"阶段。**AI聊天机器人被附加到现有工具上。我们还没有重新想象当旧的限制消解时，当你的公司可以在你睡觉时用无限思维运行时，组织会是什么样子。

---

At my company Notion, we have been experimenting. Alongside our 1,000 employees, more than 700 agents now handle repetitive work. They take meeting notes and answer questions to synthesize tribal knowledge. They field IT requests and log customer feedback. They help new hires onboard with employee benefits. They write weekly status reports so people don't have to copy-paste. And this is just baby steps. The real gains are limited only by our imagination and inertia.

在我的公司Notion，我们一直在实验。除了我们的1000名员工外，现在有700多个代理处理重复性工作。他们做会议记录并回答问题以综合部落知识。他们处理IT请求并记录客户反馈。他们帮助新员工入职员工福利。他们撰写每周状态报告，这样人们就不必复制粘贴。这只是婴儿步。真正的收益只受我们的想象力和惯性的限制。

## Economies: from Florence to megacities

## 经济：从佛罗伦萨到超级城市

---

Steel and steam didn't just change buildings and factories. They changed cities.

钢铁和蒸汽不仅改变了建筑和工厂。它们改变了城市。

---

Until a few hundred years ago, cities were human-scaled. You could walk across Florence in forty minutes. The rhythm of life was set by how far a person could walk, how loud a voice could carry.

直到几百年前，城市都是人性化的。你可以在四十分钟内步行穿过佛罗伦萨。生活的节奏由一个人能走多远、声音能传多远来设定。

---

Then steel frames made skyscrapers possible. Steam engines powered railways that connected city centers to hinterlands. Elevators, subways, highways followed. Cities exploded in scale and density. Tokyo. Chongqing. Dallas.

然后钢铁框架使摩天大楼成为可能。蒸汽机为连接市中心和腹地的铁路提供动力。电梯、地铁、高速公路紧随其后。城市在规模和密度上爆炸式增长。东京。重庆。达拉斯。

---

These aren't just bigger versions of Florence. They're different ways of living. Megacities are disorienting, anonymous, harder to navigate. That illegibility is the price of scale. But they also offer more opportunity, more freedom. More people doing more things in more combinations than a human-scaled Renaissance city could support.

这些不仅仅是佛罗伦萨的更大版本。它们是不同的生活方式。超级城市令人迷失方向、匿名、更难导航。这种难以辨认是规模的代价。但它们也提供更多的机会、更多的自由。更多的人以更多的组合做更多的事情，超过一个人性化的文艺复兴城市所能支持的范围。

---

I think the knowledge economy is about to undergo the same transformation.

**我认为知识经济即将经历同样的转变。**

---

Today, knowledge work represents nearly half of America's GDP. Most of it still operates at human scale: teams of dozens, workflows paced by meetings and email, organizations that buckle past a few hundred people. We've built Florences with stone and wood.

今天，知识工作占美国GDP的近一半。其中大多数仍然以人性化规模运营：几十人的团队，以会议和电子邮件为节奏的工作流程，在几百人就会崩溃的组织。我们用石头和木头建造了佛罗伦萨。

---

When AI agents come online at scale, we'll be building Tokyos. Organizations that span thousands of agents and humans. Workflows that run continuously, across time zones, without waiting for someone to wake up. Decisions synthesized with just the right amount of human in the loop.

当AI代理大规模上线时，我们将建造东京。跨越数千个代理和人类的组织。工作流程连续运行，跨时区，无需等待某人醒来。决策以适量的人工在循环中综合而成。

---

It will feel different. Faster, more leveraged, but also more disorienting at first. The rhythms of the weekly meeting, the quarterly planning cycle, and the annual review may stop making sense. New rhythms emerge. We lose some legibility. We gain scale and speed.

它会感觉不同。更快、更有杠杆作用，但起初也更令人迷失方向。每周会议、季度规划周期和年度审查的节奏可能不再有意义。新的节奏出现。我们失去了一些可读性。我们获得了规模和速度。

---

## Beyond the waterwheels

## 超越水轮

---

Every miracle material required people to stop seeing the world via the rearview mirror and start imagining the new one. Carnegie looked at steel and saw city skylines. Lancashire mill owners looked at steam engines and saw factory floors free from rivers.

每种神奇材料都要求人们停止通过后视镜看世界，开始想象新世界。卡内基看着钢铁，看到了城市天际线。兰开夏郡的工厂主看着蒸汽机，看到了摆脱河流的工厂车间。

---

We are still in the waterwheel phase of AI, bolting chatbots onto workflows designed for humans. We need to stop asking AI to be merely our copilots. We need to imagine what knowledge work could look like when human organizations are reinforced with steel, when busywork is delegated to minds that never sleep.

**我们仍处于AI的水轮阶段**，将聊天机器人附加到为人类设计的工作流程上。我们需要停止要求AI仅仅成为我们的副驾驶。我们需要想象，当人类组织用钢铁加固，当繁琐的工作被委托给永不休息的大脑时，知识工作会是什么样子。

---

Steel. Steam. Infinite minds. The next skyline is there, waiting for us to build it.

**钢铁。蒸汽。无限的智慧。**

**下一个天际线就在那里，等待我们去建造。**
